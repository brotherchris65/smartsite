    <h1>Keeping your journal</h1>
    <h2>Keeping track of new information</h2>
    <p>New information such as bits of code that are new to you<br>
     with a description of what the code is doing. This is where you<br>
     would also want to take special note of the formatting requirements.<br>
     You will want to label each part of formatting and how it is used.
     <p></p>
   
   <h2>Sketches and drawings</h2>
    <p>Drawing out a picture of how your code is supposed to work <span class="standout">will be a<br>
     critical step</span>. This can take the form of Pseudo_code, which is just writing<br>
     out a description, in regular language, of what you want the code to do. Another<br>
      thing here is an actual picture that you create. This might take the form of a<br>
       flowchart for code or a wiring diagram or even a drawing of how some hardware is<br>
       going to be put together.</p>
       <p class="important">Pictures or drawings to help you or someone else understand
       your project are vital.</p>
    <h2 class="typewriter"> Keeping Track of Mistakes</h2>
    <p class ="typewriter"> Yes, <span class="emphasized">even your mistakes.</span> The important thing here is that you keep track
    of the steps you take to put things right. What worked and what didn't? If you still haven't found
    a solution, think about what steps you will take next and put those in your journal with a little
    heading like <b>Next Steps:</b></p>
    <h4 class="standout">Keep track of resources</h4>
    <p>Resource can be anything from <b>online documentation to other notes</b> Keep track of
    websites that have important <i>code snippets</i> or other information that you might need to
    access at a later date.</p>

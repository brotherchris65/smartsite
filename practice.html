    <h1>Keeping your journal</h1>
    <h2>Keeping track of new information</h2>
    <p>New information such as bits of code that are new to you<br>
     with a description of what the code is doing. This is where you<br>
     would also want to take special note of the formatting requirements.<br>
     You will want to label each part of formatting and how it is used.
     <p></p>
   
   <h2>Sketches and drawings</h2>
    <p>Drawing out a picture of how your code is supposed to work <span class="standout">will be a<br>
     critical step</span>. This can take the form of Pseudo_code, which is just writing<br>
     out a description, in regular language, of what you want the code to do. Another<br>
      thing here is an actual picture that you create. This might take the form of a<br>
       flowchart for code or a wiring diagram or even a drawing of how some hardware is<br>
       going to be put together.</p>
       <p class="important">Pictures or drawings to help you or someone else understand
       your project are vital.</p>
    <h2 class="typewriter"> Keeping Track of Mistakes</h2>
    <p class ="typewriter"> Yes, <span class="emphasized">even your mistakes.</span> The important thing here is that you keep track
    of the steps you take to put things right. What worked and what didn't? If you still haven't found
    a solution, think about what steps you will take next and put those in your journal with a little
    heading like <b>Next Steps:</b></p>
    <h4 class="standout">Keep track of resources</h4>
    <p>Resource can be anything from <b>online documentation to other notes</b> Keep track of
    websites that have important <i>code snippets</i> or other information that you might need to
    access at a later date.</p>
    <h3>New Terminology</h3>
    <p class="pretty">This is an important piece. New terminology can be anything from a new
    command in your code or it could be terminology that is used to communicate information about your code.
     For example: you might have just learned <i>for loops</i> and that would be new terminology that has to
     deal directly with the command for...... You may not have known the word <b>iteration</b> which means
      the next repetition of a similar action. We don't use the word <i>iteration</i> in our actual code but 
      when we talk about what a loop does we say it iterates (repeats the steps). Each sequence of steps
      is an iteration. These are just two examples of the types of new terminology. According to the website
       programmingforbeginners.com</p>
    <blockquote><p class="pretty">Doctors do not discuss diagnoses with each other in simple terms. Medical schools
     don’t teach in simple terms, either. Medicine is complicated, so they communicate with a complicated set
      of terminology. Everyone understands the term “broken leg,” but that is too vague for a medical diagnosis. 
      Using precise terminology like “transverse compound fracture of the tibia” allows medical staff and students
       to communicate accurately.</p>

    <p class="pretty">Programming is not as complex as the human body, but it is still complex. This complexity is 
    why programming has so much terminology. There are lots of concepts, and all of those concepts have names. Just
     like in medicine, we use terminology to communicate accurately, because simple terms are often too vague.</p></blockquote>
